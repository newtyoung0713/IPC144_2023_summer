1. Why are there three types of iteration constructs 
   if we can make any one of them behave the same way? 
   Refer to your code in this workshop to help backup your answer 
   (do NOT include the code in your answer). 
   Typically, when working with arrays, 
   there is one iteration construct we favour â€“ 
   what is it and explain why it is more preferred over the other options.

A) People use FOR loop for this workshop mostly because we have the terminal value as macro has.
   However, if we use DO-WHILE or WHILE, then we have to set a condition to stop the loop, 
   and increasing a value to stop the iteration properly.
   Even we coded for DO-WHILE or WHILE nicely, but the program might be poor readability.
   Moreover, it might be maintain hardly.

2. Describe what you did to both test and debug your program. 
   How did you go about finding where the problems were located 
   (explain how you did this for both syntactic and semantic problems)?

A) When I saw there were error messages for syntactic or semantic problems,
   I would check them first, then found where the lines are.
   Furthermore, modified them one on one, such as type different, lack of a seme-colon,
   or other problems from syntactic or semantic.

3. Using the above explicit information, 
   explain each step you must take to successfully identify and fix your error.

A) To begin with the problem comes out, then check what the problem is.
   For this case is OUTPUTS DO NOT MATCH, so that may have two situations we need to think about.
   Either input was wrong, or the code was wrong.
   But for the problem here is about outputs do not match.
   So I will re-run the program, and type the accurate number for the input.
   And I think the problem will be solving and running successfully.
